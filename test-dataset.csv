372	Probably pregnant at a later date 	[]
373	Question from my side I have the idea that the cows are fertilized but that the implantation does not take place properly This company has a very high production Would the cows return irregularly due to too high a metabolism Is this measurable in the blood by measuring hormones 	[]
374	I don't see any growth So put in another 1 night and look again tomorrow morning and no tube for the time being unless there are flakes 	[]
375	So will milking with mobile search engine dare not let her in the parlor to do more 	[]
376	why not given bottles 	[]
377	Best for dry cows. If she gets well, we can dry them. She is 170 days pregnant 	[]
378	She milks well empty. How much does she care? 	[]
379	No wait until I get there 	[]
380	it took more than an hour to free cow from boxes it is not the first time dry tonight with those 3 others 	[]
